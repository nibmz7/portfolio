Feeling a little cold? Go adjust the temperature or put on a jacket. Feeling peckish? Go cook yourself a meal or order a delivery. Want to achieve that dream body? Get off the couch and go workout. Been eyeing that luxury bag? Save up until you have enough and go get it. Want to get rich? Go start a business or something. Need more time? Oh hold on a second (no pun intended). We cannot dictate time. Time does not pause. Time does not wait for you. Time is always on the move. Not event the richest of the richest can buy a second of it.

As time passes, we tend to look back. We wished we could have done things differently. Or wished we could at least have done something. This is what makes time so precious because what and how you spend your time matters. Every little thing that you do at the present is something that your future self will hold you accountable. If it brings about positive change, they will thank you. On the other hand, if your actions bring about something negative, your future self will look back with full of regrets. The same goes for actions that do nothing at all — for me these are things that waste time, and the list could be different for everyone. The point is doing something that brings no value will also be a source of regret in the future for you as you realise that could have utilised that time to do something useful.

So, let’s do our best to make the most of time. For those with big ambitions, take that small step right now and work your way up to success. For those struggling, don’t give up and keep persevering, one day you will get the break you deserve. For those going through hardships, let’s not wait until we reach that point in time when it’s too late for us to show kindness and compassion to mend what’s broken, to finally seek forgiveness for the ones we have wronged or forgive those that have wronged us.
