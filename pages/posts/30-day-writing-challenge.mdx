# Overview
One of my new year's resolution is to start writing more as a way to help me articulate my thoughts better. Aside from that, there's a very special person
who happens to be an excellent writer and I aspire to be like her ğŸŒ¸ (check out her [blog](https://nadya.one/)!). So how this challenge works is that I will write a short post everyday for 30 days.
All of these short posts will be compiled under this page. They can be about anything, but I will try to make them as interesting as possible.
So without further ado, let's get started!

# Day 1
> Time check: 2 Jan 2023, 9:37 PM

The last week of 2022 has been a real rollercoaster for me. It was filled with various emotions, starting from excitement, to anxiety and confusion, to sadness and regret, 
to epiphany and clarity, and finally to hope and optimism. I would like to share some thoughts about this past week, and specifically my view on forgiveness.
We humans are prone to make mistakes. But what makes us special is that we are given the ability to think, reflect and learn from our mistakes.
This is the basic premise of why we should forgive ourselves and more importantly, others. We are all human, and we all make mistakes.

There are however, some mistakes that may be harder to forgive than others and some even may fall within the category of unforgivable. These can be actions that transgress society's standards of acceptable, honest and 
moral behaviour. Any mistakes that does not correspond to those, in my honest opinion, should be forgiven without hesitation. There is no point in holding grudges against someone who has wronged you.
Our stay in this world is limited. Ultimately, we will all die. So why waste time over a trifle? It is not worth it.

> My parents always decides what's best for me, and I have to do what they say.

> I don't have a say in anything.

> I have to go, my parents are calling me.

> I can't do anything without my parents' permission.

> How are you able to do all these things? Did your parents allow you to?

These are some of the things I hear from my friends, and my response is always the same â€” you need to speak up for yourself. You need to stand up for yourself. You need to be your own advocate.
You need to prove to your parents that you are independent and capable of making your own decisions. This way they will trust you more and give you more freedom.

This is the part that most of my friends don't understand. They think that to do so, they need to be rebellious and go against their parents' wishes. Do things quietly and secretly. But that's not the case.
Share your plans with your parents. If they disagree with parts of it, explain to them why you think it's a good idea. If they still disagree, then you have to make a decision. Either you go with their plan, or you go with yours.
This is the part where you are truly tested. Whether your decision is based on logical reasoning or emotional reasoning. If you are able to make a decision based on logic, then you are truly independent.

What happens after you make a decision? This is the turning point. You start to execute your plan, and what comes out of it will either help increase your parents' trust in you, or it will decrease it.
Remember that even with a bad outcome of your plan, that doesn't necessarily mean that your parents will lose trust in you. It's all about how you handle the situation. Acknowledge your mistakes, and learn from them.
Communicate with your parents on what went wrong. If you are able to do that, then you will be able to gain their trust and respect.
