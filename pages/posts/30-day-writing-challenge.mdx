# Overview
One of my new year's resolution is to start writing more as a way to help me articulate my thoughts better. Aside from that, there's a very special person
who happens to be an excellent writer and I aspire to be like her ğŸŒ¸ (check out her [blog](https://nadya.one/)!). So how this challenge works is that I will write a short post everyday for 30 days.
All of these short posts will be compiled under this page. They can be about anything, but I will try to make them as interesting as possible.
So without further ado, let's get started!

# Day 1
> Time check: 2 Jan 2023, 9:37 PM

The last week of 2022 has been a real rollercoaster for me. It was filled with various emotions, starting from excitement, to anxiety and confusion, to sadness and regret, 
to epiphany and clarity, and finally to hope and optimism. I would like to share some thoughts about this past week, and specifically my view on forgiveness.
We humans are prone to make mistakes. But what makes us special is that we are given the ability to think, reflect and learn from our mistakes.
This is the basic premise of why we should forgive ourselves and more importantly, others. We are all human, and we all make mistakes.

There are however, some mistakes that may be harder to forgive than others and some even may fall within the category of unforgivable. These can be actions that transgress society's standards of acceptable, honest and 
moral behaviour. Any mistakes that does not correspond to those, in my honest opinion, should be forgiven without hesitation. There is no point in holding grudges against someone who has wronged you.
Our stay in this world is limited. Ultimately, we will all die. So why waste time over a trifle? It is not worth it.
