# JS-to-HTML Syntax highlighter

I stumbled upon [sugar-high](https://github.com/huozhi/sugar-high), a lightweight JSX syntax highlighter, project on github.
Since I have time on my hands, I thought why not go through the source code and try to implement a similar syntax highlighter myself.
I wrote the tokenizer and implemented a simple JSHighlighter [component](https://github.com/nibmz7/portfolio/blob/main/lib/JSHighlighter.jsx).
The final outcome is far from perfect and I can already imagine how much work it would be to implement a full fledged one like in a code editor.

## Result 1

This is an example of the syntax highlighting on the tokenizer [code](https://github.com/nibmz7/portfolio/blob/main/lib/tokenizer.js) itself.

<JSHighlighter code={jsString} />

## Result 2

Another example with string templates.

<JSHighlighter
  code={`\`Hello \${lol + 'banana'} 7 \${\`bye bye\` + "pineapple"}\`;`}
/>

## Result 3

Last example with multiline comments.

<JSHighlighter
  code={`/**
 * This is a multi-line JavaScript comment
 */`}
/>
